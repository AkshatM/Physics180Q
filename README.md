# Description

Some code I wrote to be able to do simple optical ray-tracing calculations for Physics 180Q. 

It 
- Defines a class `Tmatrix` that consists of a matrix representation of my system. This system can be updated to reflect additional complexity. _To be be added: a simplifying function that can remove the additional complexity if needed._
- Defines functions for calculating the minimum beam waist and radius of curvature of a Gaussian laser beam.
